Feature: Authentication # features/login.feature:1
  In order to validate authentication API
  As a tester
  I want to make sure that everything works as expected
  Scenario: Successful Login                                             # features/login.feature:7
    Given I make a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api-token-auth/ # features/steps/api_steps.py:6
    And I set header Content-Type to application/json                    # features/steps/api_steps.py:19
    And I set body to                                                    # features/steps/api_steps.py:51
      """
      {
        "username": "appuser1",
        "password": "secret123$"
      }
      """
    When I send the request                                              # features/steps/api_steps.py:64
    Then I expect response status to be 200                              # features/steps/api_steps.py:81
      Assertion Failed: Expected 200, got 500

    And I store JSON response at token as user_token                     # None
